# CProgramming-CS-F101
Codes for labs, as a Teaching Assistant for CS F101 2nd Semester 2020-21.
I would like to thank Dr. Anup for the smooth conduction of this course and the guidance he provided to all TA's.

# LAB 1
1. Write a C program to print the below text using a single printf
statement.
Martin said, “I’m going over to Jennifer’s house for a few hours.”
“You can’t be serious!” cried Fauntleroy.
“Oh, but I am,” Martin replied.
“How will you get there?” Fauntleroy asked.

# LAB 2
1. Write a C program to read  your date of birth in the given format dd:mm:yyyy only,  where dd is the date, mm is the month, and yyyy the year and store in the integer variables dob, birth_month and birth_year and print the variable values.
2. Write a C program to read only consonants. If the user enters a vowel, it should not be stored in the variable. Print the value of this character variable. 
3. Write a C program, which prompts the user to take a 4 digit integer (first digit to be non-zero) as input and displays the number as follows : First Line      : 	All digits Second line : 	All digits except first digit Third line     : 	All digits except first two digits Fourth line  : 	The Last digit
4. Write a C program (Q4.c) to display the temperature in Fahrenheit and Celcius using the following equation: Temp_Celcius = (5.0/9.0)*(Temp_Fahrenheit-32). Read precision value from the user. Display the output in the given format only.


# LAB 3
1. Write a program that takes three integers from the user and prints them in the increasing order.
2. Write a program that takes four integers from the user and prints their maximum. 
3. Write a program Q3.c that takes two integers and one of the operation +,-,*,/ from the user and prints the result of the operation on the input integers. If a user attempts to divide by zero, print “ERROR - Divide by zero”. Do NOT use if or  if-else statements in your program.

# LAB 4
1. Write a program Q1.c that takes a positive number from the user and prints the corresponding pattern as given below:

Sample Output : 1 

Enter an integer: 3
Output:
***
**
*
**
***
2. Write a program Q2.c that takes a positive odd number from the user and prints the corresponding pattern as given below:

Sample Output : 1 
Enter an integer: 3
Output:
*-*
 *
*-*

3. Write a program Q3.c that does the following steps:
Initially prompt the user to enter the balance amount.
Ask the user to enter one of the following options:
‘A’ followed by an amount.
On receiving this option, add the amount to the balance.
Display the balance.
Go to step 2.
‘S’ followed by an amount.
On receiving this option, subtract the amount from the balance.
Display the balance.
Go to step 2.
‘E’
On receiving this option, break from the loop and exit the program.

# LAB 5
1. A list of integers A is called a sublist of a list of integers B, if for any integer n in A, the number of times n occurs in B is at least as large as the number of times n occurs in A. Write a program that takes two lists of integers A,B (of possibly different sizes)  from the user, and prints YES, if A is a sublist of B, otherwise prints NO.
2. Write a program that takes a list of positive integers (>0) from the user until it sees a non-positive number, and then prints the greatest common divisor of all the positive integers in the list.
